The ipynb file is used to train the object detection models on Google Colab.
It requires a folder called training_demo with the following structure:

"""bash
└── training_demo
    ├── annotations
    ├── config_files
    ├── images
    │   ├── test
    │   └── train
    ├── preprocessing
    ├── pre-trained-models
    ├── saved_trained_models
    └── training
"""
